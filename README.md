This program was inspired by Mire De Collimation program written by Gilbert Grillot and Al's Collimation Aid. I combined best features of both and addes some of my own. Purpose of this program is not to reinvent the wheel, but rather to learn new technologies, become better at colimating my telescope and to learn something new.

Main purpose of this program is to help you with aligning optical elements of your telescope such as secondary mirror, primary mirror, focuser, etc.

Collimation Circles is developed with .NET 8 and AvaloniaUI Framework using MVVM architecture patern. Program was tested on Windows 10 and 11, Ununtu Linux 22.04.1 LTS (Wayland), Raspberry PI OS Bullseye and Bookworm. I'm not able to test it on macOS (only in virtual machine), but it should work.

Feel free to report any issues. Suggestions and contributions are welcome!

# Dependancies
Colimation circles depends on some external software for handling video streams. 

- VLC for playing video streams.
```
sudo apt-get install -y libvlc-dev
```
- v4l-utils for detecting UVC cameras and their capabilities.
```
sudo apt-get install -y v4l-utils
```
- libcamera-vid for detecting Raspberry Pi Cameras. It should already be installed on Raspberry Pi OS by default.

# Known issues

### Window transparency issues on Raspberry PI OS Bullseye

Unfortunately on some Linux distros main window is not transparent :(. I have succesfully tested it on Ubuntu that's using Wayland window manager. On Raspberry Pi OS Bullseye window transparency doesn't work out of the box. But luckily there is workaround for that.

Open terminal and type this:
```
raspi-config
```
go to advanced settings and enable Compositor. Then run this command:
```
xcompmgr
```
and then run the CollimationCircles program again. Main Window should now be transparent!

Latest version of **Raspberry PI OS Bookworm** uses newer Wayland window manager and transparency works as it should.
